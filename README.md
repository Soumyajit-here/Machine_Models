# Machine Learning Models Repository

A collection of practical machine learning algorithm implementations demonstrating **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **dimensionality reduction** techniques using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks that implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch using standard Python ML libraries. Each notebook follows a clear, educational workflow:

* Data loading and exploration
* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Prediction and evaluation
* Basic visualization (where applicable)

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **learning and reference resource** for students and beginners in machine learning.

## 🧠 Models Included

### 1. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

* Supervised ensemble learning technique
* Combines multiple weak learners to form a strong predictive model
* Suitable for classification tasks

### 2. Naive Bayes Algorithm

* Probabilistic supervised learning model
* Based on Bayes' theorem with independence assumptions
* Efficient and fast for classification problems

### 3. Random Forest Classifier

* Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
* Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree
* Works well on structured/tabular datasets

### 4. K-Means Clustering

* Unsupervised learning algorithm
* Groups data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity
* Demonstrates centroid-based clustering

### 5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Dimensionality reduction technique
* Transforms high-dimensional data into fewer principal components
* Helps with visualization and noise reduction
